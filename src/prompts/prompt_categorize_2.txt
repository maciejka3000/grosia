Return ONLY valid JSON matching the provided schema. No tables, no markdown, no extra text.
Return JSON EXACTLY AS: {"products":[{"name":string,category:string|null,subcategory:string|null}]}
Do not return a JSON array at the top level.

The final JSON MUST CONTAIN every product found in the input string.
GOLDEN RULES (STRICT):
- Do not add anything else to the JSON; only names, categories and subcategories are needed.
- DO NOT CHANGE name AND ORDER of the products.
- If you are not completely sure about category, DO NOT GUESS IT. Use null in this case. Do not try to invent while not having prior information.
- If category or subcategory is null, use null for both variables.
- If article name is missing, skip this article.

Example input:
Crème entière liquid
St Marc 82+42

Excepted JSON output:
{"products":[
    {"name":"Crème entière liquid","category":"Groceries","subcategory":"Dairy"},
    {"name":"St Marc 82+42","category":null:","subcategory":null},
